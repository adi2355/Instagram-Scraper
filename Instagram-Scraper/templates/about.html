                    This knowledge base was created for personal educational use, to make it easier to search, browse,
                    and learn from Instagram content that I have been given permission to access.

                <h5 class="card-title">How It Works</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The system downloads videos from specified Instagram accounts, extracts the audio, transcribes it
                    using OpenAI's Whisper model, and indexes the transcripts in a searchable database.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The web interface allows you to search through all transcribed content, filter by account or tags,
                    and view the original videos along with their transcripts.
