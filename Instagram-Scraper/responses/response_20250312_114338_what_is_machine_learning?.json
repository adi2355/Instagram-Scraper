  "query": "What is machine learning?",
  "answer": "The provided context does not directly define what machine learning is. However, based on the sources mentioning popular machine learning libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Transformers, I can infer that machine learning refers to the field of study that enables computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.\n\nMachine learning involves developing algorithms and statistical models that allow systems to perform specific tasks effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference from data. It enables computers to learn from experience and improve their performance on a given task over time.\n\nSome key aspects of machine learning include:\n\n1) Using algorithms to extract patterns from data\n2) Building models that can make predictions or decisions without being programmed with specific rules\n3) Improving the models' performance through experience and exposure to more data\n\nMachine learning is a rapidly growing field with applications across various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others.",
