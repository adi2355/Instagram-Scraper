I spent years of my life explaining to people that deep learning doesn't automatically take away the need for pre-processing and feature engineering. Yet on some beautiful, pure theoretical fantasy land, people think it does. In real-world data science, pre-processing and feature engineering is one of the most important parts of the process, because it helps you convey human knowledge and insight into the model. If you're working with dates, instead of giving the date of birth to the model, giving an age is pretty useful. If you're working with time series, telling the model when holidays or weekends are is totally useful. If you're working with physical objects that have relationships defined by physics, adding that physical information is important. If you're doing calculations, whether simple moving averages, ratios, differences, adding those as features helps improve your model. All of this stuff is stuff that matters. Don't think it's going to be automatically done for you just because you're using deep learning.",
