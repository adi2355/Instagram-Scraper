ML engineers discuss why cutting-edge academic models aren’t production-ready and often don’t justify the implementation costs. They share practical alternatives that work better:
* Simpler models that need less compute
* Quality data labeling over complexity
* Rules-based approaches with domain knowledge
* Data cleaning tools like cleanlab
The key message: understanding your specific problem and data beats chasing the latest complex architectures.
