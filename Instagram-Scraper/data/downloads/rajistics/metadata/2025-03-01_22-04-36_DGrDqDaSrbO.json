    "caption": "Sparsity is the concept of leveraging zeros in data and models for efficiency. Sparse representations enable working with massive datasets by storing only non-zero values, saving memory and computation. Applications include data compression, dropout in neural networks, L1 regularization, and conditional computation in models like Mixture of Experts.",
