    "caption": "LLMs can streamline existing AI/ML operations by replacing specialized models (e.g., BERT for classification, SpaCy for NER, T5 for summarization) with a single foundation model that handles multiple NLP tasks through prompt engineering, reducing both infrastructure complexity and maintenance overhead. The consolidation eliminates the need for task-specific data preprocessing pipelines, model retraining cycles, and separate deployment environments, while also potentially replacing costly external API services for tasks like translation and data annotation - though with the caveat that human oversight remains crucial for quality assurance and edge cases.",
