    "caption": "Grok 3 - The video explains how Grok 3’s performance claims rely on majority voting across 64 predictions (cons@64) rather than single predictions (cons@1). While this consensus-based approach significantly boosts accuracy scores, it requires 64 times more computing power and isn’t practical for real-world use. The video points out that when measuring single-prediction performance, Grok 3 isn’t actually leading the pack.",
