    "caption": "The video contrasts complex neural networks with simpler, interpretable models like Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), which provide clear coefficients showing each featureâ€™s impact on predictions. Rule-based approaches derived from decision trees offer another interpretable option, though they present a trade-off between accuracy and explainability. Scorecards are highlighted as one of the simplest modeling approaches, demonstrating how complex algorithms can sometimes be used to build more interpretable solutions.",
