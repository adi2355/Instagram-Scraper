    "caption": "ML engineers discuss why cutting-edge academic models aren’t production-ready and often don’t justify the implementation costs. They share practical alternatives that work better:\n* Simpler models that need less compute\n* Quality data labeling over complexity\n* Rules-based approaches with domain knowledge\n* Data cleaning tools like cleanlab\nThe key message: understanding your specific problem and data beats chasing the latest complex architectures.",
